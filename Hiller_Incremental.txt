Incremental 
1.	Users should be able to request information regarding their schedules and personal information that comes from a SQL database.
2.	Users should be able to request information through a UI, and schedule meetings with advisors and professors should be able to update their office hours and basic test should be implemented to reduce bugs.
3.	Users should be able to use UI to add/drop and view their class schedules, updates meetings, and access the calendar.  Add/Drop should be prerequisites includes to prevent students taking classes not available to them. Testing should cover the whole software product and be automated using a testing framework. 




Micah Rieley Notes:

Jared, I would recommend being more specific in your Incremental Development model. Instead of broadly saying "Users", I would instead 
list what you want specific classes to be able to do in each version. I feel that this would help make what needs to be done for each class 
more obvious.
