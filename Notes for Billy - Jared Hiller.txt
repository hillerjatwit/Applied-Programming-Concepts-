Notes for Billy

Waterfall:
Students should not be able to edit their attributes, able to make request for change, only admin
can make changes

Should be implementing a prerequisite system

Incremental:
The admin class should be included in the first iteration for easier testing and debugging
Also should have SQL integration in the first itegration so we can expand and fix any issues
we may incounter earlier in development

Integration:
Should be including 3rd party resources and open source resources to make development easier
Should be using some sort of SQL server to host and UI development platform for development.
