Waterfall:
Paragraph 1 - change "This means it will cost anything" to "This means it will NOT cost anything"
In op and maintenance, the testing process would not be done here, instead in implementation and unit testing

Incremental:
- Fix the font to be more consistent
- Otherwise good

Integration:
- Fix model name type (you spelled it Intigration)
- An admin table is missing
