Integration and Configuration
In Assignment 3, we are given three tables to use. These tables are for Student, Instructor, and Admin. 
The tables contain the same information we were planning to include into our tables. So, it would be beneficial 
to integrate these precreated tables into our project.
The assignment also contains some code that we could integrate. For example, code for creating a table.

Last semester, I worked with objects and classes in my object oriented programming class. There are many old 
labs and projects I have done that contain classes that could be integrated into the LeopardWeb Project.
Doing this will be very useful because my memory of how to set up things like inheritance is somewhat foggy. 
So, inheriting old code with a combination of some research to refresh exactly how it works will make the
process move quicker when compared to relearning all our old techniques.

Micah Rieley Notes : 
I like how you added each section of the user as different versions, the only thing I would say is that it may complicate things by having a fully flushed out version of the student created and then create a full version of the professor and then the admin. It could complicate things as for some interactions, instead of creating simple interactions first and then making them more advanced, youâ€™d just start by creating an advanced version which may make things a bit more difficult
