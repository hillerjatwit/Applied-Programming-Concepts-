Integrate and Configure
1.	Use Visual Studio and C# to develop classes and functions that will be able to store user information and show information to the user through the command line. 
2.	Use PostgreSQL and a Linux host to host a database to store all users information and link it to visual studio through â€¦ package
3.	Use Qt to develop a user interface for the software instead of using the command line. Underneath the UI, the code we developed before implementing the UI will be able take in user inputs and display and update what the user needs. 
4.	Use Nunit and Selenium to develop tests for our software by simulating button clicks and keyboard strokes that would be made by a user. 



Micah Rieley Notes:
I really like what you wrote although i think integrating and utilizing selenium, Nunit, some of the other tools may be a but more in depth them what we need for this project but for a big/professional setting it would definetly be a good idea
