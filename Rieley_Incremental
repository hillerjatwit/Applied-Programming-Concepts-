Incremental Development 

Our primary objective is to allow students, teachers, and admins to be able to access a single site which can change functionality depending on which user is utilizing the site. The first iteration of the website will have very bare bones functionality and only the base necessities as far as functionality for the site. Once these features are added, the higher specialized/additional features can be added, but for he base, the following will be used: 

A database that is capable of storing multiple data types, not just users, but also  the total courses, so it will include, Students, Teachers, and Admins, along with all the classes and who is in each class. This should allow for students to be able to access the classes they are in while the teachers can see who are in their classes and the admins can edit any of the existing information. This should allow for each user type to have their own info but also be able to interact with each other. 

Student: Name, ID, registered courses 

Faculty: View full course roster, and print schedule 

Admin: add/remove users, add/remove coursesâ€™ and search and print rosters. 

A table to store the course catalogue and additional information. 

Course name 

Course Details(ie. Times and how many are allowed to take it) 

Who teaches the course 

 

Once the initial website has been created, then the specialization/additional features can be added. 

Students can create plans. So they once course registration is open, they can automatically sign up for all classes at once 

Add courser pre-requisites so students can only sign up for courses that they have the necessary course history, 

Allow the admin to override the course capacity or course pre-requisites if needed 

Add the functionality so students can search courses by what general field they are in(ie. ELEC or MEC) and a list of the classes in that field are shown.  

The ability to only allow a student to sign up for a course once
