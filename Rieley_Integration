Using Integration and Configuration, start by looking online to get a base idea of what you are going to try and do. From there, you can alter or change some code to get it to help you attain you desired results.

After finding a source to follow, using this source gives you a few important pieces that can be altered/used to benefit the project, this includes helping with creating a database, helping with testing if the database is open, creating and deleting items from the database, and selecting items.  

 

I would start by implementing how they created the database, although while doing it, it is important to change the inputs/values in the table, so they align with what we want to use it for. For example, for a student table, we would want their name, their grad year, their ID, first name, last name, email, and major, but for instructor we want a different set, so for each table,  it's important we have separate tables for each so the data doesn't get mixed or any other issues. 

 

For selecting, deleting, and adding, it is a similar case, we need to alter the code to make it so it would be usable with the data we would be adding or searching for. This will allow us to be able to use the functions for our needs such as searching for students by last name or WIT ID number, but also adding students with certain data, such as only first or last name but not having any classes yet.

You are missing details on how you would incorporate the admin class and cource table
