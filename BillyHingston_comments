1. Micah, I would suggest adding a few notes into your waterfall method. Especially under the Design for System section just to make 
the what the functions can do and the restrictions on them more obvious. 
2. Micah, for your Incremental Development, I would suggest making the versions that you would want to create over time more clear. 
3. Jared, I would recommend being more specific in your Incremental Development model. Instead of broadly saying "Users", I would instead 
list what you want specific classes to be able to do in each version. I feel that this would help make what needs to be done for each class 
more obvious.
